module Views.Article.Feed exposing (Model, Msg, init, selectTag, update, viewArticles, viewFeedSources)

{-| NOTE: This module has its own Model, view, and update. This is not normal!
If you find yourself doing this often, please watch <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoA4Txr4GUs>

This is the reusable Article Feed that appears on both the Home page as well as
on the Profile page. There's a lot of logic here, so it's more convenient to use
the heavyweight approach of giving this its own Model, view, and update.

This means callers must use Html.map and Cmd.map to use this thing, but in
this case that's totally worth it because of the amount of logic wrapped up
in this thing.

For every other reusable view in this application, this API would be totally
overkill, so we use simpler APIs instead.
